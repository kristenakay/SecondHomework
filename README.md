# SecondHomework

In this project I added some bootstrap templating, I changed the navigation bar to breadcrumbs from bootstrap, and I changed the contact form to be styled by bootstrap. I deleted any redundant code in order to increase organization and I added pusedocode to help explain my code. I added a media query to make the header work on smaller screensizes. I also changed the text inside boxes to resize based on the parent div and screen size.
