In this project I added some bootstrap templating(not really but I'm going to I ran out of time), I changed the navigation bar to breadcrumbs from bootstrap, and I changed the contact form to be styled by bootstrap. I deleted any redundant code in order to increase organization and I added pusedocode to help explain my code.
